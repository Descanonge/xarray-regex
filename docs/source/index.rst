Xarray-regex documentation
==========================

Welcome to the Xarray-regex package documentation !

Xarray-regex allows to find files based on regular expressions, in order to feed
them to Xarray.
It allows to easily create regular expressions, to fix some elements of the
expressions to select only certain files, and to easily retrieve information
from filenames.
